**polify** have no dependencies and all you need is the `polify` script in your PATH. Use the Makefile to do a systemwide installation of both the script and the manpage.  

(*configure the installation destination in the Makefile, if needed*)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/budlabs/polify.git
$ cd polify
# make install
$ polify -v
polify - version: 2019.08.05.1
